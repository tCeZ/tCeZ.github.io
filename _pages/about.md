About Me
======

I'm a 1st Year PhD student in Machine Learning at Carnegie Mellon University. Before that I obtained my B.S. from the University of Pittsburgh in Mechanical Engineering, Computer Science, and Chemistry. I have spent time at Uber, Amazon, and ViZ - aquired by General Dynamics - working mostly as a software engineer. 

My research interests are in multimodal learning, generative models, deep learning, and optimization. 

My hobbies are currently valorant.
